<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a student in South KoreağŸ‡°ğŸ‡·.<br />
  I was born in 2002, and I am studying in a College in the U.S.ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸<br />
  Programming is my hobby, and I want to get a job on it.<br />
  I studied little bit of Java and Python, but it felt a bit boring, so I
  decided to study web development too!<br />
  I will make an application and websites by my own.<br />
